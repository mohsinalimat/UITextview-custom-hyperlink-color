    <p>We believe that a <a href="http://yourlinkhere.com" class="yellowLink" >company</a> that has values and acts on them can really change the world. And an <a href="http://yourlinkhere.com" class="greenLink" >individual</a> can too. That can be you. That must be you.
    Graduates, your values matter. They are your <a href="http://yourlinkhere.com" class="redLink" >North Star</a>. Otherwise it’s just a job — and life is too short for that.</p>
